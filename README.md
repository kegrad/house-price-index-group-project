# House Price Index Group Project

## Initial data
Data is provided from https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/uk-house-price-index-data-downloads-july-2022  
We first look at the Average Prices from that link.
From that page the [About the UK HPI](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/about-the-uk-house-price-index/about-the-uk-house-price-index) has lots of detail about how the data was constructed, what the columns mean etc.


## Quick analysis

To get a first impression of the data in the Avaerage Price excel sheet, I've created inital-graph.ipynb

It's not imediately obvious to me what the different regional levels are covered in it, and how to tell which data belongs to which type of regional area.

Not all data from all areas exists for all time

## Next ideas?

We could do some quality checks to make sure that smaller areas add up to the totals of their larger areas

Interactive graphs of the regions and years

Or maps
